# Insurance Cost Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project builds a **machine learning regression model** to predict **insurance charges** based on customer attributes such as age, BMI, smoking status, and region.  
The notebook follows a complete **data science workflow** from exploratory data analysis to model building.
